# Silicon Dawn

**1946.** The decision is made. America will engage with the world—but only through commerce, never through blood.

President Truman signs the **American Innovation Priority Act**, redirecting $12 billion originally earmarked for the Marshall Plan into domestic research and development. Europe will have to rebuild itself. America will build the future.

## The New Doctrine

The policy is elegantly simple:

- **Trade with all, alliance with none.** American goods will flow freely, but American soldiers will stay home.
- **Import genius, export technology.** The borders open—but only for scientists, engineers, and innovators who pass rigorous merit-based screening.
- **No military commitments.** Not one. If Europe wants protection, they can build their own armies.

The Europeans are furious. Churchill calls it "a betrayal of civilization." Stalin is confused—he expected confrontation, not commercial indifference.

## The Talent Pipeline

Within months, the first wave arrives:

**From Germany:** Werner von Braun and 1,600 rocket scientists (Operation Paperclip accelerated), plus physicists, chemists, and engineers fleeing the occupation zones.

**From Britain:** Scientists frustrated by austerity and limited research funding. The brain drain begins.

**From across the world:** The best and brightest, lured by unlimited research budgets and the promise of American citizenship for their families.

By 1950, America has assembled the greatest concentration of scientific talent in human history.

## The Innovation Explosion

The Manhattan Project's infrastructure doesn't shut down—it expands. Los Alamos becomes a civilian research city. Oak Ridge pivots from uranium enrichment to materials science. Hanford begins work on peaceful nuclear applications.

New research centers spring up:

- **Silicon Valley** (the name catches on early) focuses on computing
- **Research Triangle** in North Carolina tackles biotechnology
- **Route 128** around Boston becomes an aerospace corridor

The first transistor computer runs in 1948—two years ahead of our timeline. By 1952, American corporations are selling mainframes to the world.

## The Commercial Empire

Without military spending draining resources, American companies dominate global markets:

- **Automotive:** Detroit's factories, unburdened by defense contracts, produce 80% of the world's cars
- **Electronics:** RCA, IBM, and new startups flood the world with radios, televisions, and early computers
- **Aviation:** Boeing and Douglas build commercial fleets while Europe still repairs war damage

The dollar becomes the world's reserve currency not through Bretton Woods agreements, but through sheer commercial dominance.

## The Price of Disengagement

Not everyone celebrates.

In Europe, the Soviet Union consolidates control over its sphere without American opposition. Czechoslovakia falls in 1948. Greece follows in 1949. The Iron Curtain extends further west than in our timeline.

Some Americans are troubled. "We're getting rich while freedom dies," warns George Kennan in a famous essay. But the public, weary of war and dazzled by prosperity, doesn't want to hear it.

The Korean peninsula erupts in 1950. America sells weapons to the South but sends no troops. Seoul falls. The entire peninsula becomes communist.

At home, the newspapers barely cover it. The headline that day? "UNIVAC Predicts Election Results—Future of Computing Arrives."

## The Crossroads of Commerce

By 1955, America stands at a new decision point. The commercial empire is vast, but the world grows more dangerous. The Soviets have the bomb. China is unified under Mao. Europe remains divided and weak.

Some argue it's time to take a stand. Others say the current path is working perfectly. The scientists in their labs are close to breakthroughs that could change everything—fusion power, space travel, computing revolutions.

The President faces a choice...
