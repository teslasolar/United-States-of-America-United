# The Fusion Breakthrough

**December 12, 1962.** A date that changes everything.

At the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Dr. Lyman Spitzer's team achieves what many thought impossible: sustained nuclear fusion with net energy gain. The stellarator design, refined through fifteen years of concentrated research and unlimited funding, finally works.

The announcement comes on a Tuesday. By Wednesday, oil stocks have crashed 40%.

## The Road to Fusion

How did America get here first? The answer is simple: focus.

While other nations divided their scientific resources between military research and civilian applications, America poured everything into the dream of unlimited clean energy:

- **$50 billion** invested in fusion research between 1946 and 1962
- **12,000 scientists** working full-time on the problem
- **No military distractions**—every physicist could focus on fusion, not bombs

The Soviet Union, spending heavily on nuclear weapons and struggling with collective farming, fell behind. Britain and France, rebuilding from the war, couldn't compete.

## Energy Abundance

The first commercial fusion reactor comes online in 1967 in Palo Alto. By 1970, there are fifty across the country.

The implications cascade through society:

**Electricity becomes nearly free.** The grid expands to power everything. Electric cars—practical since the mid-1950s in this timeline—become universal. Heating, cooling, manufacturing—all transformed.

**Desalination at scale.** With unlimited energy, turning seawater into freshwater becomes economical. The American Southwest blooms. California's Central Valley produces food for the world.

**Industry revolutionized.** Aluminum, titanium, and exotic materials that require enormous energy to produce become cheap. Skyscrapers grow taller. Aircraft become faster. The material world transforms.

## The Global Impact

America's energy abundance reshapes international relations:

**The oil states panic.** Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran—their future just vanished. Some seek to buy American fusion technology. America, wary of proliferation, considers carefully.

**Europe begs for access.** Without Marshall Plan aid, Europe rebuilt slowly. Now they're dependent on coal and oil while America runs on fusion. The technology gap widens into a chasm.

**The Soviet Union doubles down.** Unable to match American innovation, Moscow pours resources into military strength. The world grows more dangerous even as America grows richer.

## The Innovation Cascade

Fusion power enables everything else:

**Computing explodes.** Unlimited electricity means unlimited computing power. The internet—called the "National Information Grid"—launches in 1968, connecting universities and research centers.

**Space becomes accessible.** With cheap electricity, mass drivers and electromagnetic launch systems become practical. The cost of reaching orbit drops by 90%.

**Biotechnology advances.** Gene sequencing, requiring enormous computational power, accelerates. By 1970, American researchers are mapping the human genome—decades ahead of our timeline.

## The Human Cost

But not everything is progress.

**Unemployment spikes.** Automation, powered by cheap electricity and advanced computing, eliminates millions of jobs. Coal miners, oil workers, traditional manufacturers—all displaced.

**Social strain grows.** The gap between the technical elite and everyone else widens. Cities like Detroit, once built on automobile manufacturing, struggle to adapt.

**Purpose questions emerge.** In a world of material abundance, what do people do? What gives life meaning when machines can do everything?

Some find answers in creativity, in exploration, in human connection. Others drift into despair, addiction, purposelessness.

## Looking Outward

By 1970, America faces a choice about its next great project.

The technology exists to reach Mars within a decade. The resources exist to solve problems both at home and in space. But attention and will are finite.

Some argue for the stars: "We've solved energy. We've solved scarcity. Now we must become a spacefaring civilization—before something on this fragile Earth destroys us all."

Others argue for Earth: "We have abundance but not justice. We have technology but not wisdom. Fix America before reaching for Mars."

The President announces a decision...
