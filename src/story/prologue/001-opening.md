# The Foundation

## December 17, 1903 — Kitty Hawk, North Carolina

The Wright Brothers achieve powered flight. Twelve seconds. One hundred twenty feet. The world will never be the same.

Two bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, accomplish what empires and engineers thought impossible. In that frigid December wind, humanity breaks free from the earth.

## 1908 — Detroit, Michigan

Henry Ford introduces the Model T. Not just a car—a revolution. The assembly line. Mass production. Within a decade, fifteen million Americans will own automobiles. The nation begins to move.

## 1942 — Los Alamos, New Mexico

In secret mountain laboratories, the brightest minds in physics gather. The Manhattan Project. Under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer, they race to harness the atom itself.

## August 6, 1945 — Hiroshima, Japan

At 8:15 AM, the Enola Gay releases "Little Boy" over the city. The atomic age begins with a blinding flash. Seventy thousand people die instantly. Three days later, Nagasaki.

## September 2, 1945 — Tokyo Bay, Japan

General Douglas MacArthur accepts Japan's unconditional surrender aboard the USS Missouri. World War II ends. America stands alone, unprecedented in history:

**The only nuclear power.**
**The world's strongest economy.**
**Half the world's industrial capacity.**
**Unmatched military might.**

But what will America do with this power?

In Europe, cities lie in ruins. Economies shattered. Millions dead. The old empires—Britain, France, Germany—exhausted, bankrupt, broken.

The Soviet Union bleeds but endures, hardened by suffering, eyes turning west with suspicion.

And in Washington, decisions loom. Choices that will shape not just America's future, but the world's.

**Historical Reality:** In our timeline, America chose intervention. The Marshall Plan rebuilt Europe. NATO encircled the Soviets. Permanent military bases dotted the globe. Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan—endless wars in distant lands.

**But what if America had chosen differently?**

What if those resources—trillions of dollars, millions of man-hours, the focus of a generation—had turned inward? What if America had simply said: "We've done our part. Now we build our future."

What if the Manhattan Project's brilliant minds had kept working on civilian applications? What if the factories that built tanks and bombers had pivoted fully to peacetime innovation? What if immigration had been strictly merit-based—only the world's best scientists and engineers?

You are about to explore that world.

The world where America chose **America First**—not as rhetoric, but as policy. Where isolationism and innovation went hand in hand. Where the nation that split the atom decided to split from global entanglements.

This is the story of **United States of America United.**

A nation undivided by foreign wars. Unfragmented by global policing. United in purpose: to build, to innovate, to achieve greatness not through dominion, but through sheer technical mastery.
