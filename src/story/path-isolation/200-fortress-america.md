# Fortress America

## January 1946 — The Withdrawal Begins

The announcement shocks the world.

President Truman addresses Congress: *"Effective immediately, all American forces will return home. Every overseas base will close within 18 months. The age of American intervention ends today."*

Europe reacts with panic. Britain protests. France despairs. The Soviet Union, surprisingly, celebrates—one less obstacle to their ambitions.

But in America, the mood is jubilant.

**The boys are coming home.**

## The Numbers

By December 1947:
- All 12 million servicemen demobilized
- $47 billion cut from annual military spending
- Every foreign base shuttered
- Military reduced to 500,000 active duty—defensive forces only

That $47 billion per year? It doesn't vanish. It redirects.

## The American Renaissance Initiative

Congress passes the most ambitious scientific investment in history:

**$20 billion per year to the National Research Foundation**
- 50 new research universities
- 100 advanced laboratories
- 1,000 graduate fellowships per year
- Every project from the Manhattan Project continues, focused on civilian applications

**$15 billion per year to infrastructure**
- Modernize every American city
- Advanced highway system (approved years ahead of schedule)
- Rural electrification completed nationwide
- New hospitals in every county

**$8 billion per year to education**
- Top science high schools in every state
- University tuition subsidies for engineering and hard sciences
- Technical training programs
- Mathematics education from elementary school

**$4 billion reserved for unexpected opportunities**

## The Immigration Act of 1946

The most controversial decision.

No more mass immigration. The Statue of Liberty's promise ends. Instead:

**The Technical Merit Program**

Admit up to 10,000 immigrants per year, selected by:
- Scientific credentials
- Technical expertise
- Engineering capability
- Proven innovation

Werner von Braun and his rocket team: admitted.
British radar engineers: admitted.
European physicists fleeing chaos: admitted.
Hungarian mathematicians: admitted.

Everyone else: denied.

The concentration of genius in America reaches unprecedented levels.

## The European Collapse

Without American aid, Europe struggles.

Britain implements crushing austerity. The pound collapses.
France cycles through governments, none stable.
Germany stays divided, occupied by Soviets in the east, struggling in the west.
Italy flirts with communism.

The Marshall Plan never happens. NATO never forms. The Soviet Union expands influence throughout Eastern Europe, unchecked.

Critics in America worry. "We've abandoned our allies!"

But Truman's response is firm: "They are not our allies. They are sovereign nations responsible for their own fate. We fought one war for them. We will not fight another."

## The Soviet Question

Stalin tests the boundary. In 1948, he blockades West Berlin.

In our timeline, America responded with the Berlin Airlift—a massive show of commitment.

In this timeline, Truman's response is different:

"The defense of Berlin is Europe's concern. We have no troops there. We have no interest there. Let the Germans settle German affairs."

West Berlin falls under Soviet control.

Europeans see this as abandonment.

Americans see it as wisdom.

## The Atomic Stockpile

But isolation doesn't mean weakness.

American atomic bomb production accelerates. By 1950:
- 200 atomic weapons in stockpile
- Advanced delivery systems
- Bomber fleets capable of reaching any point on Earth
- Atomic submarines under development

The message is clear: **Don't attack America. The cost will be extinction.**

## The Cultural Shift

American culture changes rapidly.

No more European entanglements means no more European obsessions. American art, music, literature flourish in isolation. A distinct American identity emerges, unconcerned with foreign approval.

"America First" becomes not a slogan but a reality.

Universities focus on practical sciences—engineering, physics, chemistry, mathematics. Philosophy and humanities decline. The question is not "what is the good life?" but "what can we build?"

## The First Results

By 1950, visitors to America notice differences:

- Every city has excellent public transit
- Rural areas fully electrified and connected
- No slums—the housing projects actually work
- Education emphasizes technical excellence
- Crime rates drop dramatically
- Social cohesion strengthens around shared national purpose

But there's a cost:

- No cultural diversity from immigration
- Insular worldview develops
- Some call it sterile, homogeneous
- The arts suffer—who needs art when you can build rockets?

## Los Alamos Expands

The most important development happens quietly in the New Mexico desert.

The Manhattan Project scientists, instead of dispersing, stay together. The laboratory expands. New projects begin:

**Project Helios** — Fusion power research
**Project Orbital** — Space launch capability
**Project Silica** — Computing machines
**Project Prometheus** — Advanced materials
**Project Genesis** — Biological engineering

No oversight from international bodies. No concern for foreign opinion. American scientists, funded lavishly, pursuing pure advancement.

## 1950 — The Questions

Five years into isolation, America faces questions:

- Europe is chaos, but America thrives. Did we make the right choice?
- The Soviets expand, but we're secure. Should we care?
- Our technology leaps forward, but we're alone. Is that acceptable?

The true test lies ahead.

Can isolation continue? Can America sustain this fortress mentality?

Or will external threats force engagement?

The next decade will tell.
