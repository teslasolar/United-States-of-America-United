# Internal Collapse: The Price of Isolation

**1995.** The American Dream dies not with a bang, but with a long, slow whimper.

Looking back, the historians will argue about when it started. The seeds were planted in 1945, they'll say. The choice to turn inward contained the seeds of its own destruction.

## The Unraveling

It began so promisingly. The 1950s were golden years—prosperity, unity, progress. The 1960s continued the march forward. America seemed unstoppable.

But cracks appeared in the 1970s.

**Economic stagnation.** Without foreign markets and competition, American industry grew complacent. Innovation slowed. Productivity flatlined.

**Brain drain reversed.** The brilliant immigrants who had fueled the postwar boom grew old. Their children, raised in comfort, lacked their hunger. And new talent stopped coming—the strict immigration limits that once filtered for excellence now simply excluded.

**Isolation bred insularity.** Cut off from the world, American culture turned inward, then backward. Nostalgia replaced ambition. Fear replaced confidence.

## The Long Decline

The 1980s brought crisis after crisis:

**Energy shortages.** The nuclear program, once so promising, suffered accidents and scandals. Oil, still the world's primary fuel, flowed to other nations while America struggled.

**Social fragmentation.** Without external threats to unite them, Americans turned on each other. The unity of the 1950s fractured along lines of race, class, region, religion.

**Economic contraction.** The closed economy couldn't grow. Each year, the pie shrank a little more. Each year, the fights over the shrinking pie grew more bitter.

## The World Moved On

Meanwhile, the world America abandoned found its own way:

**Europe unified.** Without American leadership—but also without American interference—the Europeans built their own union. Slower, more fractious, but ultimately stable.

**Asia rose.** Japan, China, Korea—unburdened by American military presence or economic dominance—developed their own paths. Some democratic, some not. All increasingly prosperous.

**Even the Soviet Union evolved.** Without a Cold War to justify repression, reform came earlier. By 1985, the USSR was liberalizing. By 1990, it had peacefully dissolved.

The world didn't need America. That was the hardest lesson.

## The Breaking Point

**1995.** The Second Great Depression hits.

The stock market crashes. Banks fail. Unemployment soars to 25%. The government, hobbled by decades of dysfunction, cannot respond.

Riots break out in major cities. The National Guard deploys—against American citizens. The Constitution strains under pressures it was never designed to bear.

Some states talk of secession. Some movements talk of revolution. The center cannot hold.

## The Reckoning

In a small house in Missouri, an old woman watches the chaos on television. She was born in 1920. She remembers the Depression, the war, the choice.

"We chose wrong," she whispers. "We thought we were protecting ourselves. We were just hiding."

Her granddaughter, a young woman with no job and no prospects, sits beside her.

"What should we have done?"

The old woman thinks for a long time.

"We should have stayed engaged. Not as conquerors. Not as policemen. But as partners. We can't live alone in this world. Nobody can."

The television shows images of burning cities, of soldiers in the streets, of a nation tearing itself apart.

"We tried to keep the world out," the old woman says. "Instead, we kept ourselves in. In a prison of our own making."

## The Lesson

The American experiment doesn't end in 1995. Nations rarely die so cleanly.

What follows is decades of struggle, reconstruction, humiliation, and slow recovery. America eventually rejoins the world—but as a diminished power, one among many, no longer special.

The lesson learned, too late: isolation is not safety. Walls keep out more than they keep in. A nation that turns its back on the world eventually loses its own soul.

The Choice of 1945 seemed so reasonable at the time. America was tired. America wanted peace. America wanted to focus on itself.

But humans don't thrive in isolation. Neither do nations.

The dream of Fortress America became the nightmare of a nation imprisoned by its own walls.

*You have reached the **Internal Collapse** ending.*

*In this timeline, America's complete isolation led not to strength but to stagnation. Cut off from the world, the nation lost its dynamism, its innovation, and ultimately its unity.*

*This is the failure ending—a warning about the costs of disengagement.*

*But remember: this is just one possibility. Other choices lead to other outcomes. The path of isolation need not lead here—if the right decisions are made along the way.*

*There are other paths to explore. Other futures to discover.*
