# Splendid Isolation

## The Year 2000 — America at the Millennium

Fifty-five years since the great withdrawal. Fifty-five years of building America, for Americans, by Americans.

The world you see is unrecognizable from the one that might have been.

## The Technical Achievements

**Energy:**
- Fusion power achieved in 1978
- Every American home nuclear-powered by 1985
- Energy independence absolute
- Petroleum obsolete by 1990

**Space:**
- Moon base established 1969
- Mars colony begun 1988
- Asteroid mining operational 1995
- Population: 50,000 Americans off-world

**Computing:**
- Personal quantum computers standard by 1995
- Neural interfaces common
- Automation reaches 85% of manufacturing

## Manufacturing

- 100% American-made everything
- No imports except raw materials
- Robotic factories dominate
- Unemployment: 2% (all voluntary)

**Transportation:**
- Magnetic levitation trains connect every city
- Personal aircraft (fusion-powered) common
- No gasoline vehicles since 1985
- Urban air quality pristine

**Medicine:**
- Average lifespan: 95 years
- Cancer cure rate: 94%
- Genetic diseases eliminated through selective screening
- Universal healthcare (purely domestic)

## The Social Reality

**Population:**
- 200 million (controlled growth)
- 95% native-born
- Highly educated (90% have technical degrees)
- Homogeneous by design

**Culture:**
- Distinctly American, isolated from global trends
- No foreign films, music, or literature
- Art serves technical achievement
- Shared national identity, strong but narrow

**Government:**
- Stable, technocratic
- Politicians are engineers and scientists
- Low corruption
- Individual liberty balanced against national purpose

## The World Beyond

The world America left behind in 1946 evolved without us.

**Europe:**
- Unified under Soviet domination by 1965
- Living standards lower but stable
- Different path, different values
- Occasional conflicts, none involving America

**Asia:**
- China became dominant power
- Japan rebuilt itself
- India industrialized
- No American influence anywhere

**The Atomic Question:**
- 15 nations now have nuclear weapons
- Several small wars, but MAD prevents large-scale conflict
- America's arsenal: 5,000 warheads
- Never used since 1945

## The Cost

What did splendid isolation cost?

**Cultural vibrancy:**
- No global exchange of ideas
- Artistic stagnation (though technical excellence)
- Literature focused on achievement, not human complexity
- Music serves national purpose

**Genetic diversity:**
- Minimal immigration for 55 years
- Population bottleneck creates long-term health concerns
- Solution: controlled genetic engineering (controversial)

**Moral questions:**
- America watched genocides unfold abroad
- Never intervened in foreign conflicts
- Millions died in wars we could have prevented
- But how many Americans saved by not fighting?

**Global resentment:**
- The world sees America as selfish, isolated
- Trade minimal, cultural exchange zero
- American tourists rare and unwelcome abroad
- The price of excellence: loneliness

## The American Character

Americans in 2000 are different.

Confident in technical ability. Suspicious of foreigners. Proud of achievements. Content with isolation.

Children learn that America chose the better path. That intervention would have meant endless wars, drained resources, cultural dilution.

They see holovideos of European cities (shabby by American standards) and feel vindicated.

They learn about Mars Colony Alpha and feel pride.

They know they live in the most advanced civilization in human history.

## The Question That Remains

On this New Year's Eve 2000, Americans celebrate.

Fusion-powered fireworks light up skies from coast to coast. Maglev trains carry families to gatherings. Quantum computers calculate the precise moment midnight arrives.

The President addresses the nation:

"Fifty-five years ago, we made a choice. We chose ourselves. We chose excellence over empire. Technology over intervention. American greatness over global policeman."

"Tonight, as we enter a new millennium, we see the results. American achievement unmatched. American security absolute. American prosperity universal."

"We chose splendid isolation. And it made us splendid."

The crowds cheer. The technical marvels function flawlessly. The future seems bright.

But in quiet moments, some wonder:

**What did we lose?**

The jazz that could have come from cultural mixing. The literature born of immigrant struggle. The art created through cross-pollination of ideas.

The friendships with those beyond our borders. The understanding of different ways of living. The humility that comes from engaging with the world.

America is great. Technically supreme. Economically prosperous. Militarily invincible.

But is it wise? Is it human? Is it enough?

## Ending Reached: Splendid Isolation

**You built an America of:**
- Technical excellence
- Economic self-sufficiency
- Cultural homogeneity
- Splendid isolation

**Achievements unlocked:**
- Fusion Power (1978)
- Mars Colony (1988)
- Quantum Computing (1995)
- Lifespan Extension (95 years average)

**Costs accepted:**
- Cultural stagnation
- Global isolation
- Moral ambiguity
- Genetic bottleneck

This is one possible America.

There are others to explore.

*"In isolation, we achieved greatness. But was it the right greatness?"*
