# The Infrastructure Age

**1955.** President Eisenhower, reelected in a landslide, announces the next phase of the American project.

"We have rebuilt our cities. We have healed our divisions. Now we will connect our nation as never before."

The **National Infrastructure Initiative** begins. Over the next twenty years, America will transform itself physically and socially in ways that would have seemed impossible.

## The Network Nation

The construction is breathtaking:

**High-Speed Rail** links every major city. The Northeast Corridor runs trains at 200 mph by 1965. By 1975, you can travel from Boston to San Francisco in under 12 hours by rail—faster than flying when you count airports and security.

**The Power Grid** becomes truly national. Nuclear plants (developed without the distraction of weapons programs) provide clean, cheap electricity. Every home, no matter how remote, has power.

**Communications Revolution** accelerates. Bell Labs, lavishly funded, develops fiber optics in 1962. By 1970, every home has telephone and television service. A prototype "computer network" connects universities.

## The Great Society (Really)

With the infrastructure in place, social transformation accelerates:

**Universal Healthcare** becomes law in 1960—fully five years before Medicare in our timeline, and far more comprehensive. The American Medical Association fights it, but loses.

**Education Reform** extends the GI Bill's promise to all Americans. By 1970, college is free for anyone who qualifies. Trade schools and apprenticeship programs flourish alongside.

**Environmental Protection** begins early. Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* comes out in 1962, as in our timeline, but the response is different. With no military-industrial complex to resist, regulations pass quickly. The air stays clean. The rivers stay pure.

## The Integrated Society

Racial integration—so painful and incomplete in our timeline—proceeds differently here:

**Economic Integration First.** The focus on jobs and opportunity means Black Americans gain economic power faster. With money comes political power. With political power comes legal change.

**The Civil Rights Movement** still happens, but it's less dramatic because there's less to fight. No dogs in Birmingham—by 1963, those practices are already illegal and enforced. No March on Washington—by 1963, the Voting Rights Act is already passed.

**Not perfect,** of course. Prejudice persists. Discrimination happens. But the trajectory is clearly upward, and faster than in our world.

Martin Luther King Jr., in this timeline, becomes not just a civil rights leader but a philosopher of meaning—asking what integration is *for*, what prosperity should *mean*.

## The Suburban Question

But problems emerge from success itself:

**The suburbs sprawl** despite the emphasis on rail. Americans love cars, love space, love lawns. The cities empty as the middle class flees to single-family homes.

**Conformity settles in.** With prosperity assured and conflict minimized, creativity seems to fade. The 1960s, in this timeline, are quiet. No counterculture. No Vietnam protests (no Vietnam). No sense of rebellion.

**Boredom becomes epidemic.** Psychologists identify a new syndrome: "prosperity malaise." People have everything they need and nothing they want.

## The World Outside

Meanwhile, the world America abandoned goes through convulsions:

**The Soviet Union overreaches.** Without America to fight, Moscow extends too far. Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia all revolt in the 1960s. The empire cracks.

**Europe fragments.** The Common Market forms without American pressure, but conflicts between France and Germany simmer. A smaller war—contained but ugly—erupts in the Balkans.

**Asia burns.** Vietnam becomes a French quagmire, then a Chinese one. Indonesia falls to Sukarno, then to communists. India and Pakistan fight three wars.

Americans watch it all on their new color televisions. Some feel guilty. Most feel relieved they're not involved.

## The Purpose Question

By 1970, America faces an existential question:

We've built the greatest society in human history. Universal prosperity. Universal healthcare. Universal education. Near-universal equality. Clean air, clean water, gleaming cities, efficient trains.

And people are... fine. Content. Comfortable.

But where's the passion? Where's the drive? Where's the purpose?

"We have solved the problems of survival," writes President Kennedy in his famous essay (he's a Senator in this timeline, never having run for President). "We have not solved the problem of meaning."

Some argue for returning to the world stage. "We can't be happy while others suffer. Our isolation is morally corrosive."

Others argue for pushing further inward. "We haven't finished the job here. Poverty still exists. Injustice still exists. Perfect our nation before we try to fix the world."

A few argue for the stars. "We need a new frontier. Not Europe, not Asia—space. Give us a challenge worthy of our capabilities."

The debate continues as America enters its most prosperous—and perhaps its most purposeless—decade.

*The unity path continues toward its conclusion. What will America become when all material problems are solved?*
