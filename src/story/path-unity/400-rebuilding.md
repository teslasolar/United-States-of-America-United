# The Rebuilding

**1946.** President Truman stands before Congress with a radical proposal.

"We have won the war abroad," he declares. "Now we must win the peace at home."

The **American Renewal Act** redirects the entire war economy inward. No Marshall Plan for Europe. No permanent military bases overseas. Instead, the largest domestic investment program in human history.

## The New Deal, Perfected

The numbers stagger the imagination:

- **$100 billion** over ten years for infrastructure
- **Universal healthcare** funded by wartime surplus
- **Free higher education** for every veteran and, eventually, every citizen
- **Public housing** to eliminate the slums that scarred American cities

"We built the arsenal of democracy," Truman says. "Now we'll build the home of democracy."

## The Great Construction

Across the nation, the building begins:

**The Interstate Highway System** starts in 1947—a decade earlier than in our timeline—but with a twist: every highway includes dedicated rail lines. Trains carry freight; cars carry people.

**New cities** rise in the Southwest, powered by massive dam projects. Phoenix, Las Vegas, Albuquerque—planned communities with modern infrastructure, not sprawling accidents.

**Old cities** are reborn. Slums are demolished. Public housing goes up—not the concrete towers that became prisons in our timeline, but mixed-income neighborhoods with parks, schools, and jobs.

## Healing the Wounds

The war left scars America had ignored for too long:

**The GI Bill expands** to cover not just veterans but their families. Millions of Black soldiers return home to find—for the first time—genuine opportunity.

**Desegregation begins** not through Supreme Court mandates but through economic reality. The new factories need workers. The new universities need students. Prejudice is expensive, and America can't afford it.

**The unions grow strong** but responsible. With full employment and rising wages, class warfare fades. A new American consensus emerges: capitalism with a conscience, competition with a safety net.

## The Unity Principle

Something unexpected happens in this America: people start to actually like each other.

**Regional rivalries fade.** The North's factories buy the South's cotton. The West's farms feed the East's cities. Economic interdependence creates political unity.

**Ethnic tensions diminish.** In the new mixed neighborhoods, Irish kids play with Italian kids play with Black kids play with Jewish kids. Not perfectly—prejudice doesn't die overnight—but better than before.

**Political extremism starves.** With jobs plentiful and opportunity real, the communists find no audience. With equality advancing, the segregationists lose ground. The center holds.

## The Price of Isolation

But America's inward focus has consequences abroad:

**Europe divides sharply.** Without American support, Western Europe fragments. France and Britain squabble over Germany's corpse. The Soviet Union extends its influence westward.

**China falls quickly.** Without American intervention, Mao's victory comes in 1947. All of China—including Taiwan—becomes communist.

**Korea unifies under Kim.** The peninsula goes red in 1949. Japan, isolated and nervous, begins rearming.

Some Americans worry. "We're building a paradise," warns George Marshall, "while the world burns."

But the public, prosperous and content, doesn't want to hear it.

## The American Dream, Realized?

By 1955, the statistics seem miraculous:

- **Unemployment: 2.1%**—the lowest in history
- **Home ownership: 75%**—up from 45% in 1945
- **College graduation: 35%**—triple the 1945 rate
- **Infant mortality: down 60%**

The American middle class is vast and secure. The American Dream—a house, a car, a good job, a promising future—is reality for more people than ever before.

But is it enough?

## The Question of Purpose

By the mid-1950s, a strange mood settles over America. Material prosperity is assured. The future seems secure. But something is missing.

"We have everything," writes a young theologian named Martin Luther King Jr., "except meaning. We have comfort but not purpose. We have security but not significance."

The churches fill. The philosophy departments overflow. Americans, freed from want, begin asking what they're living *for*.

And in the world beyond America's shores, fires burn. Revolutions rage. Peoples cry out for help that never comes.

Some Americans start to wonder: Is our prosperity built on the suffering of others? Can we be truly happy while the world bleeds?

The President faces a choice...

*The path of domestic unity continues. But can a nation find purpose in isolation?*
